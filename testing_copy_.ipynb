    "ResNet mean error converges to a asymptote while DenseNet continues oscillating. This indicates that DenseNet had some issue during training and did not output a very optimal model. High oscillation tends to indicate that the learning rate is too high or that the training might benefit from using an optimiser with momentum. DenseNet is ostensibly a more sophisticated model as it has both more layers and parameters this did not appear to hold in practice. It appeared the model underfit to the female portion of the dataset while ResNet which is comparitively simple did. We theorise this is due to the DenseNet having vanishing gradient issues due to its high layer count. While DenseNet is intended to prevent vanishing gradients, the pytorch implementation only uses dense blocks. The layers inside these blocks possess dense connections but subsequent layers only receive inputs from the previous dense block's output layer. This saves on computational complexity by bringing down the number of weights but is not as effective at preventing vanishing gradients. The ResNet model however used fewer layers and took advantage of skip connections. Since it uses summation as opposed to concatonation to bypass layers, it is more computationally efficient. Due to this, the model does not need to be split into blocks and the outputs from earlier layers can reach all later layers. This theory would explain our concerns about vanishing gradients. Additionally, when we examined the model weights for our trained DenseNets, we found that many of the earlier weight parameters had changed by no more that 10^-4^, further supporting the vanishing gradient issues. This is a strong indicator but further testing would be required.\n",

    "As discussed, research suggests that discrepencies between men and women in facial recognition is not due to dataset bias but differences in facial structure. Another difference between ResNet and denseNet is their choice of pooling algorithms. Max pooling is likely better at learning to find edges and contours in images as average pooling has a propensity to smooth values. If we assume, women tend to have softer features and therefor less defined contours on their face, it may be harder for a model using average pooling to identify these contours. Since men tend to have more defined features with more contrast, the model may cope better. This is reflected in our models as DenseNet performed worse than ResNet and Resnet features many more max pooling layers while densenet contains many average pooling layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "While underfitting can also be a symptom of poor hyperparameter selection or insufficient data, we do not believe this to be the case. The models were both trained on large datasets and we had spent some time testing  hyperparameters that would produce satisfactory results for all models.\n",

    "#### Further Discussion\n",

    "Clearly, the inherent differences between male and female facial structure can pose problems when developing facial recognition models. We have shown this is largely independent to any dataset bias. While we have identified the cause of these issues further work would be required to determine the extent of this bias. Since we have only tested on three landmarks, we are unable to determine if these issues effect all landmarks or if there is a small subset that are responsible.\n"

If the denseNet performance improves while the resnet decreases, this would support the literature.\n",

    "Our experiments thus far have provided promising insights into why facial recognition performs worse for certain groups, and more specifically genders. We were able to pinpoint differences in facial structure as a major contributing factor and some model design choices such as pooling algorithms that may exaserbate these issues. Additionally, we were able to find a model that was relatively unbiased whislt producing low errors. These findings have helped verify existing research and can help influence future facial recognition development to be fairer."
